      The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, and the ISS is now the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth.[8][9] The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays, and other components. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.ISS serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and other fields.[11][12][13] The station is suited for the testing of spacecraft systems and equipment required for missions to the Moon and Mars.[14] The ISS maintains an orbit with an altitude of between 330 and 435 km (205 and 270 mi) by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the Zvezda module or visiting spacecraft. It completes 15.54 orbits per day. This about section is about the ISS and all information that will tell you more about it. Do not over complicate it this is very simple in fact im pretty sure my dog terra can understand. Terra is a dog and yes to our knowledge we humans think dogs can not read but you all do not know my dog terra she is brilliant she has me trained to let her out whenever she stands by a door and she has me trained to give her food at specific time each day. who owns who i wonder but anyway back to what i was saying about the about page for this iss things just read and learn something cool. </p>
